Flash talk at the JAIST–OIST Joint Symposium.<br><br>

This flash talk introduces a cultural evolution perspective on circular economy (CE) transition
in manufacturing SMEs.<br><br>

Building on Schein’s model of organizational culture and Teece’s dynamic capability theory,
the study explains how CE-oriented culture emerges, evolves, and contributes to sustained
circular transformation.<br><br>

Using cross-case qualitative analysis of CE-mature SMEs in China and Japan, the presentation
highlights the interaction between leadership assumptions, organizational practices,
and external pressures, and shows how participatory meaning-sharing processes reinforce
proactive CE engagement beyond compliance-driven adoption.<br><br>

Keywords: Circular Economy; Organizational Culture; Cultural Evolution; Dynamic Capabilities; SMEs
