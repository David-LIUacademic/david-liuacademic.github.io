Flash talk at the JAIST–OIST Joint Symposium.  

This talk introduces a cultural evolution perspective on circular economy (CE) transition
in manufacturing SMEs. Building on Schein’s model of organizational culture and
Teece’s dynamic capability theory, it explains how CE-oriented culture emerges,
evolves, and contributes to sustained circular transformation.  

Using cross-case qualitative analysis of CE-mature SMEs in China and Japan, the presentation
highlights the interaction between leadership assumptions, organizational practices,
and external pressures, and shows how participatory meaning-sharing processes reinforce
proactive CE engagement beyond compliance-driven adoption.  

Keywords: Circular Economy; Organizational Culture; Cultural Evolution; Dynamic Capabilities; SMEs
