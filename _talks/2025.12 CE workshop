Workshop theme:<br>
Contemporary Global Business Trends and the Essentials of Wisdom Management.<br><br>

In this workshop, I presented a critical discussion on whether digitalization and servitization
should be regarded as necessary strategies for circular economy (CE) transition.<br><br>

Drawing on comparative case studies of manufacturing SMEs, the presentation examined how
digitalization (e.g., automation, traceability, AI-enabled logistics) and servitization
(e.g., customized design, maintenance-oriented PSS) contribute differently to CE outcomes.<br><br>

The findings suggest that while digitalization and servitization can significantly accelerate
CE transition, they are not universally required.<br><br>

Keywords: Circular Economy; Digitalization; Servitization; Wisdom Management; SMEs
